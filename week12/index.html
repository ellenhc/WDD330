        <h1>Week 12</h1>
        <p>This week I began really working on my block 2 project. I first created the HTML form that the user would use to select their trivia options. I then styled it with CSS. I began on the JavaScript the next day by writing the code that grabs the
            user's input.
        </p>
        <p>I met with my team early Thursday morning for the team activity. Unfortunately, it was not well attended so our dicussion wasn't as helpful as expected. We did discuss our block 2 projects, and the two of us that met realized we were using the
            same API. It was interesting to see how our projects differed even though the overall idea was the same - a trivia game.</p>
        <h2>Report</h2>
        <p>This week I spent the first half of the week working on my block two project. I started by working on the HTML and CSS for how I wanted the page to look. Then I began work on the JavaScript. My app starts with a form where the user selects some
            options for their trivia game (number of questions, category, etc.). Then I process the form to get the necessary URL for the trivia API. I had planned on making it much further than that so far, but this week was busier than usual. Anyway,
            I met with my team on Thursday morning, I added some notes about what I worked on this week to my GitHub portfolio, and I finished the week by writing this report.</p>
        <p>Next week I plan on putting a lot more hours into my project than I have thus far. This is because one of my other class group projects finished up earlier than expected so I have more free time. Well, hopefully. I also have another group project
            that is starting to be coded next week too.
        </p>
        <p>Blockers this week were feeling like I didn’t have enough time for everything. It felt like whenever I wasn’t at work, I was constantly on a Zoom call for school or church callings.
