        <h1>Week 12</h1>
        <p>This week I began really working on my block 2 project. I first created the HTML form that the user would use to select their trivia options. I then styled it with CSS. I began on the JavaScript the next day by writing the code that grabs the
            user's input.</p>
        <p>I met with my team early Thursday morning for the team activity. Unfortunately, it was not well attended so our dicussion wasn't as helpful as expected. We did discuss our block 2 projects.</p>
