        <h1>Week 14</h1>
        <p>I began the week by working further on the score box. Previously the score only incremented where the viewer could see when a new question was rendered. After a lot of fiddling, I got it to now to visibly increase as soon as the user selects a
            correct answer. Basically I created a renderScore function that the renderStats function calls. That way I can call the renderScore function again as part of the click event handler for selecting the correct answer.</p>
        <p>My next problem is that after the user goes through all the questions from the API, the renderOneQuestion function is still trying to load another question. I need to come up with a way to end that process and show some kind of ending message.
            Maybe a goodbye message and showing the user's results? I ended up using an if statement that checks if the currentQuestionIndex equals the questionList array length. If they are equal, the renderGoodbye function is called. If they are not
            equal, renderOneQuestion is called instead.</p>
        <p>For the ending screen, I also created a "play again" button that reloads the page to return to the original form.</p>
        <p>I added sound effects for when the user clicks a correct versus incorrect answer. Right now it needs more work, because if you click quickly through the questions, the sound doesn't play for each click. I think we had to do something similar to
            tackling this issue in the team activity for week 9.</p>
        <p>I spent a good chunk of Tuesday trying to create a modal that would pop up to show the user the correct answer when they chose incorrectly.</p>
        <h2>Report</h2>
        <p>In many ways, I think I learned the most in this class during the last three weeks I've been working on my final project. Although there's still some topics the class covered that I don't completely understand, I feel a lot more confident in my
            abilities.</p>
