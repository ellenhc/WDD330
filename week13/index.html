        <h1>Week 13</h1>
        <p>I feel like I really became more positive about my project this week and made a lot of progress.</p>
        <p>I created a couple of render functions to render HTML to my page to show the trivia questions pulled from the OpenTrivia API. I then styled the trivia questions with CSS. For example, I added a hover color when an answer is hovered over and added
            effects so the correct answer turns green when clicked, and an incorrect answer turns red. There’s also some transitions so the color change isn’t too abrupt.</p>
        <p>After getting the first question to pull up on the page, I created buttons so that the user can move on to the next question. I then added a div at the top left corner of the page to keep track of the user’s score. Right now, the score only increments
            when the user presses the next button, so I need to keep working on that. I’m thinking of adding a timer to this box as well.</p>
        <p>Other things I worked on were little kinks like the user was able to select multiple answer choices. Now they are limited to one. I’d like to also add functionality to show what the correct answer was if the user is incorrect. I also need to add
            some sort of “ending” page for when all the questions have been answered.</p>
        <p>Overall, I feel like this project has been a good learning experience and I don’t have any blockers. Obviously I sometimes run into issues that I don’t know how to solve right away, but Googling, trial and error, and asking family questions have
            helped me get past that.</p>
