        <h1>Week 14</h1>
        <p>I began the week by working further on the score box. Previously the score only incremented where the viewer could see when a new question was rendered. After a lot of fiddling, I got it to now to visibly increase as soon as the user selects a
            correct answer. Basically I created a renderScore function that the renderStats function calls. That way I can call the renderScore function again as part of the click event handler for selecting the correct answer.</p>
        <p>My next problem is that after the user goes through all the questions from the API, the renderOneQuestion function is still trying to load another question. I need to come up with a way to end that process and show some kind of ending message.
            Maybe a goodbye message and showing the user's results? I ended up using an if statement that checks if the currentQuestionIndex equals the questionList array length. If they are equal, the renderGoodbye function is called. If they are not
            equal, renderOneQuestion is called instead.</p>
        <p>For the ending screen, I also created a "play again" button that reloads the page to return to the original form.</p>
        <p>I added sound effects for when the user clicks a correct versus incorrect answer. Right now it needs more work, because if you click quickly through the questions, the sound doesn't play for each click. I think we had to do something similar to
            tackling this issue in the team activity for week 9. Yes, I was right. We set the currentTime back to 0 before requesting to play a sound again.</p>
        <p>I spent a good chunk of Tuesday trying to create a modal that would pop up to show the user the correct answer when they chose incorrectly. Previously I thought about just using an alert popup but it felt like a bad user experience design. I decided
            against both these methods and will probably use an empty element at the bottom of the trivia container instead.
        </p>
        <p>The timer is giving me some trouble. I have an idea in a CodePen that seems to be working, but not when I translate it over into the application needed for my trivia app. I will probably use setInterval(). I did end up getting the timer to work
            periodically. But I realized it was only "loading" 60% of the timer bar so I switched my methods so the bar filled 100% of the way. But that complicated the code and I've been banging my head trying to find a solution. Part of me is tempted
            to just remove the timer, but I've already put so much work into it that I'd like to use it. Basically, for a long time, the timer wasn't actually incrementing the width of the timer bar. It just kept throwing out 1. I ended up needing the
            grab the width of the actual timer element and then it incremented. Then I was able to add code so that once the time is up, the user isn't allowed to answer anymore. This is done in the same way I did it for what happens after the user clicks
            an answer: the "done" class is applied. Then it shows what the correct answer choice was. Once that was done, I realized my timer was no longer stopping when the user did answer a question. Apparently I had accidentally redeclared my setInterval
            variable.
        </p>
        <p>As a last tie in to what we learned this semester, I had planned on separating my JavaScript into at least three files, but I ran out of time. After dealing with other classes, work, and getting kinks ironed out of the timer functionality, there
            just wasn't enough time left to figure out how to pull apart my code. I suppose now it would've been better if I had kept everything separated as I coded, because now my functions intertwine visual representaiton, functionality/updating, and
            linking those two categories.</p>
        <h2>Report</h2>
        <p>In many ways, I think I learned the most in this class during the last three weeks I've been working on my final project. My project has required that I use lots of DOM manipulation, fetch, event listeners, forms, arrays, if statements, etc. Although
            there's still some topics the class covered that I don't completely understand, I feel a lot more confident in my abilities.
