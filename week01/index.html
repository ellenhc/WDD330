        <h1>Week 01</h1>
        <h2>Reading</h2>
        <h3>Remembering User's Info</h3>
        <p>Output: information stored or shared with the user</p>
        <p>Input: anything coming in from where it was stored or anything the user enters</p>
        <p>When you want to get the user's input from any input or text area tag, you use 'value.'</p>
        <p>When you want to show something to a user, use 'innerHTML.'</p>
        <h3>Story Editor</h3>
        <a href="story_editor.html">Link</a>
        <p>A lot of the information in this section was review, like input, textarea, placeholders, etc.</p>
        <p>I am confused by the code in the samples. For example, some "" around id names are missing. There also aren't any semicolons at the end of the JavaScript statements. Also a couple references I've seen say to put the script tag in the body so I
            don't know what's correct.</p>
        <p>Key-value pairs: the storyName is the key and the storyHTML is the value.</p>
