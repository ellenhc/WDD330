        <h1>Week 01</h1>
        <h2>Reading</h2>
        <h3>Remembering User's Info</h3>
        <p>Output: information stored or shared with the user</p>
        <p>Input: anything coming in from where it was stored or anything the user enters</p>
        <p>When you want to get the user's input from any input or text area tag, you use 'value.'</p>
        <p>When you want to show something to a user, use 'innerHTML.'</p>
        <h4>Story Editor</h4>
        <a href="story_editor.html">Link</a>
        <p>A lot of the information in this section was review, like input, textarea, placeholders, etc.</p>
        <p>I am confused by the code in the samples. For example, some "" around id names are missing. There also aren't any semicolons at the end of the JavaScript statements.</p>
        <p>Key-value pairs: the storyName is the key and the storyHTML is the value.</p>
        <h3>Master Mobile UX</h3>
        <p><q>If you design for the smallest, least powerful device first, then you will focus on the content, and your
                core functionality. That leads to simple, beautiful apps. If you do it the other way around, it'll be
                like trying to put a marshmallow into a piggy bank, which is neither simple, nor beautiful.</q> -Joel Marsh

        <p>This is an important idea for me to think about. I often want to start coding for desktop screens first despite many resources saying to do mobile first. This is especially relevant since mobile use is so prevalent. Do mobile first! I'm basically
            doing responsive retrofitting when I'm starting from scratch and could easily do mobile first.</p>
        <p>It's important to consider that not everyone has access to fast networks. 3G is still very common in some parts of the world.</p>
        <p>Consider reachability with one handed grip on mobile devices. It's never occurred to me to put the navigation at the bottom of the screen, but that's where it's easiest for users to access.</p>
        <p>Not everyone knows what the hamburger icon means. Putting menu in a border had the most clicks.</p>
        <p>Make it simple so people can use is easily. Forms are more mobile-friendly if they fit on one page. Float labels look really good for forms, but are they accessible for screen readers and the like?</p>
        <p>Using an anchor tag, you can link your phone number. It makes it easier for people to call from mobile devices.</p>
        <p>Ads inside content should be small (unobstrusive) and simple. Stop using pop-ups.</p>
