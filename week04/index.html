        <h1>Week 4</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>Forms</h2>
            <p>Apparently it's becoming more common to use JavaScript to process information in a form on the 'frontend.' That's something I didn't know before, although I did know a bit about validation.</p>
            <p>So pretty soon after the chapter begins, it mentions usability and accessibility. In my last class, we were taught that it was better to use labels instead of placeholders because placeholders are problematic for screen readers. Would it be
                better to have a default text inside the input field that then disappears if the user clicks it?</p>
            <p>Using a for loop, you can iterate over a collection of checkbox elements. The checkbox objects can only have the values true or false.</p>
            <p>I don't really understand why a hidden input field would be useful. Would one example be including information the user previously submitted in a form from a previous visit to the website?</p>
            <p>HTML5 has its own validation API, but it isn't supported by all browsers yet. We can also use JavaScript to implement custom form validation.</p>

            <h2>OOP</h2>
            <p>OOP is a style of programming that involves separating the code into objects that have properties and methods. This allows for encapsulation. Encapsulation keeps the inner working of an object hidden inside with only the essential functionailities
                being exposed to the end user. OOP also allows for polymorphism, which is that various objects can share the same method. OOP also includes inheritance, which means that we can take an object that already exists and inherit all its properties
                and methods.</p>
            <p>I honestly didn't know until last week that you could do OOP with JavaScript. I'm currently in a Java class right now so I really understand when the textbook says that Java is a "class-based language."</p>
            <p>JavaScript contains a nmber of built-in constructor functions such as Object, Array, and Function that can be used to create objects, array, and functions instead of literals. However, it's almost always recommended to use literals for arrays.</p>
            <p>By convention, the names of constructor functions or class declarations are capitalized.</p>
            <p>The ES6 class declarations are preferable to the constructor function syntax because they are more succint, easier to read, and all code in a class definition is implicitly in strict mode.</p>
            <p>The static keyword can be used in class declarations to create a static method. These are called class methods in other languages. Static methods are not available to instances of the class.</p>
            <p>Prototypal inheritance means that every class has a prototype property that is shared by every instance of the class. So any properties or methods of a class's prototype can be accessed by every object instantiated by that class.</p>
            <p>All classes and constructor functions have a prototype property that returns an object. There are a number of ways to find the prototype of an object: the constructor function's prototype property, Object.getPrototypeOf(), proto property,
                isPrototypeOf().
            </p>
            <p>It is not possible to overwrite the prototype by assigning it to a new object literal if class declarations are used. It is possible to do this if constructor functions are used, but it sounds problematic. An object instance can overwrite
                any properties or methods inherited from its prototype by simply assigning a new value to them.</p>
            <p>The prototype can be used to add any new properties and methods after the class has been declared. It should be used to define any properties that will remain the same for every instance of the class.</p>
            <p>Never use arrays or objects as a default value in prototype.</p>
            <p>By default, an object's methods are public in JS. This means they can be queried directly and changed by assignment. But giving users or external services too much access to properties and methods could be dangerous.
            </p>
            <p>Properties of objects in JavaScript are said to beenumerableornon-enumerable. If they aren't enumerable, this means they will not show up when a for-in loop is used to loop through an objectâ€™s properties and methods.
            </p>
            <p>A class can inherit from another class using the extends keyword in a class declaration.</p>

            <h2>Modern JavaScript</h2>
            <p>A JavaScript library is a piece of code that provides several methods that make it easier to acheive common tasks. jQuery is the most popular of all the JavaScript libraries used today.</p>
            <p>The jQuery library uses the $ symbol as a convenient alias for the global jQuery object that contains all of jQuery's methods.</p>
            <p>Underscore and Lodash are other libraries. They both provide a large number of utility functions under the namespace _ character. These libraries are very similar since Lodash started as a fork of Underscore. Basically, Lodash does everything
                Underscore does, but also adds some extra features.</p>
            <p>Disadvantages to using libraries:
                <ul>
                    <li>You need to include the code for the library as well as your own code. This increases the amount of code that needs to be downloaded by a website.</li>
                    <li>Libraries might fail to implement the functionality in the precise way that you want it to perform.</li>
                    <li>Using a library can also make your code slower than using plain vanilla JavaScript because there are often more lines of code in using the abstracted functions in a library rather than writing a direct implementatio in just JavaScript.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>VanillaJS showcases plain JavaScript as if it were a library, highlighting the many tasks that can be accomplished with a similar amount of code but much better performance. But, libraries are still popular, especially when supporting older
                browsers.
            </p>
            <p>A module is a self-contained piece of code that provides functions and methods that can be then used in other files and by other modules. This helps keep code organized in separate, resusable files, which improves code maintainability. The
                code in a module should have a single purpose, and group together functions with distinct functionality.</p>
            <p>Two pieces of code are said to be tightly coupled if one relies on the other to run.</p>
            <p>Default exports refer to a single variable, function or class in a module that can be imported without having to be explicitly named. Having more than one default export will result in a syntax error.</p>
            <p>Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a design pattern that's been used for a long time in server-side languages. It's a common way of designing software. Lately it's been used in JavaScript code to make it easier to organize large-scale web apps.
                Models are objects that implement the functionality for creating, reading, updating, and deleting specific pieces of information about the application. Views provide a visual representaiton of the model showing all the relevant information.
                Controllers link models and views together by communicating between them. They also respond to events.</p>
            <p>Aurelia, Angular, and Ember are MV* Frameworks.</p>
            <p>Many MVC frameworks use templating languages to insert dynamic data into the page. Templates can be written in HTML or another language that compiles into HTML. Templating languages allow HTML to be separated from the JS program, making maintenance
                easier because they're no longer tightly coupled.</p>
            <p>Templating languages often have a mechanism for inserting dynamic data into the HTML. These tend to fall into two camps: placing dynamic code inside curly braces {{}} or inside the special "%>" tags.</p>
            <p>React and Vue.js are libraries that deal with just the view layer of MVC. They have the single goal of making it easierto update the user interface while also keeping what is displayed synchronized with underlying data that it's representing.</p>
            <p>Package managers allow developers to download modules from a central repository. A package is just a directory with one or more files of code, as well as a package.json file that contains information about the code in the package.</p>
            <p>The Node Package Manager (npm) allows you to install JavaScript packages onto your machine. To find a package, you can use the search command. The npm init command is used when you start a project. To install a package locally, the install
                command is used. </p>
            <p>Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are systems of distributed servers that can deliver web resources to a user based on their geographic location. This means they're able to deliver content quickly and efficiently with a high degree of availability.</p>
            <p>You can combine all the scripts into a single minified and compressed file. This file is often named 'bundle.min.js' to signify that it's a number of files bundled together and has also been minified.</p>
            <p>The optimal position for the script tag is right at the end of the page, just before the closing body tag. This will ensure the page has finished loading before the JavaScript code is processed.</p>
            <p>Code transpilers take JS code and turn it into JS code. A code transpiler allow syou to write your code in the lastest version of ECMAScript and then converts it into an older variant of JavaScript that is compatible with most browsers. Babel
                is the most popular transpiler.</p>
            <p>Minification is the process of removing any unnecessary characters from your code to reduce the file size. This includes all comments, whitespace, and other characters that are superfluous. Some popular minifiers are YUI Compressor, Google's
                Closure, and UglifyJs. FIles can also be compressed on the server using a file-compression tool such as gzip.</p>
            <p>The root of any folder structure should contain the index.html file. Code that needs to be transpiled is often placed inside a folder called src. The output of any transpiled code from the src folder is usually placed inside a dist folder.
                Any modules are usually stored in the lib folder. Third-party libraries are often placed inside a vendor folder.</p>
            <p>Modular organization groups files by feature rather than type. So instead of placing all the JS files in one place, we would put all the files associated with a certain feature together in a single file.</p>
            <p>Webpack is a module bundler that takes all the JavaScript files used in your project and bundles them altogether in one file.</p>

            <h2>Report</h2>
            <p>Throughout the week, I read read about forms, object oriented programming, and modern JavaScript in the JavaScript: Novice to Ninja textbook. I took notes while I read and typed them up for my GitHub portfolio. I began looking at the team
                activity on Wednesday to prepare for my team meeting. I built a tic-tac-toe board using divs and figured out how to make it look the way the first stretch goal wanted. I met with my group on Thursday morning. We completed the core goals
                and the first stretch goal, although we did review Austin's code since he figured out how to add logic. After meeting with the group, I polished up more of my personal attempt at the team activity and completing more textbook reading.
                I also joined this class's slack channel too.</p>
            <p>It looks like things will be a little different next week because the Challenge One: Todo application begins. I'm a little nervous for that, but also excited. Next week I will also read about testing and debuggin in the textbook and meet with
                my group. The team activity is locked so I have no idea what we'll be working on yet.</p>
            <p>My blockers this week was the reading. I'm in three classes right now that all heavily rely on readings at the beginning of the week, so it was hard to be motivated to sit down and read three long chapters for this class. Now, not all chapters
                are the same. For example, I didn't mind reading about forms, but the Modern JavaScript section was pretty dense and hard to understand since we haven't used most of that stuff before. I guess I just don't feel like I learned that much
                from that chapter because none of it really "stuck." Maybe some videos would help get the ideas across in a more engaging medium?</p>
